# Velvet-CLI

Velvet-CLI is a collection of CLI tools I write in various different computer languages. I will add more over time and even do the same one in different languages to learn more about programming and coding.

### Velvet-CLI-Tools:
- Auto Sprite-Sheet spitter (bash) - splites your sprite-sheet into individual images.
- Markdown to Shell Script (bash/python/js-ts/go/rust) - converts code blocks in md into shell script.
