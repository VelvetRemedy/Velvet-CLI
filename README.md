# Velvet-CLI

Velvet-CLI is a collection of CLI tools I write in various different computer languages. I will add more over time and even do the same one in different languages to learn more about programming and coding.

### Velvet-CLI-Tools:
- Auto Sprite-Sheet spitter (Bash) - splites your sprite-sheet into individual images.
- Markdown to Shell Script (Bash) - converts code blocks in md into shell script.
- Markdown to Shell Script (Python) - converts code blocks in md into shell script.
